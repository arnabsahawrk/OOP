(a) Write the difference between List and Dictionary of Python.

A List in Python is an ordered collection of elements that can hold any type of data. It is written inside square brackets [ ] and the elements are accessed using index numbers like 0, 1, 2, etc. Lists allow duplicate values and can be modified after creation since they are mutable.

# Example
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
print(fruits[1])     # Output: banana

On the other hand, a Dictionary is an ordered collection that stores data in the form of key–value pairs. It is written inside curly braces { }, with each item defined as key: value. Dictionaries are also mutable, but unlike lists, their keys must be unique while the values can be duplicated.

# Example
person = {"name": "Arnab", "age": 26, "city": "Dhaka"}
print(person["name"])  # Output: Arnab

(b) Write about *args and **kwargs of Python with proper examples.

In Python, *args and **kwargs are used when we don’t know in advance how many arguments will be passed to a function.

The *args parameter allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments (like numbers, strings, etc.). Inside the function, all these arguments are stored as a tuple.

# Example
def add_numbers(*args):
    print(sum(args))

add_numbers(2, 3, 5)   # Output: 10

Similarly, **kwargs allows a function to accept any number of keyword (named) arguments. Inside the function, they are stored as a dictionary where each key corresponds to its value.

# Example
def show_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

show_info(name="Arnab", age=26, city="Dhaka")

# Output:
# name: Arnab
# age: 26
# city: Dhaka
