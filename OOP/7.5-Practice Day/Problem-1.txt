Q: Write what is meant by operator overloading and method overriding with examples.

Operator Overloading: Operator Overloading means giving special meaning to built-in operators (+, -, *, etc.) for user-defined classes.

So we can use operators on objects just like with numbers or strings.

Python lets us do this by defining special methods (also called “dunder” methods) such as:

__add__() for +

__sub__() for -

__mul__() for *

__str__() for print() representation

Method Overriding: Method Overriding means redefining a method in a child class that already exists in its parent class.
The child’s version replaces (or overrides) the parent’s version during runtime.

It’s a key part of polymorphism and dynamic dispatch.
