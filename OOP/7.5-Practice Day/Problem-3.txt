Q. Write down 4 differences between the class method and static method with proper examples.

Class Method
1. Decorator: @classmethod
2. First Argument: Takes cls (refers to the class itself)
3. Access: Can access or modify class variables
4. Use Case: Used when behavior depends on the class

Static Method
1. Decorator: @staticmethod
2. First Argument: Takes no special first argument
3. Access: Cannot access class or instance variables directly
4. Use Case: Used when behavior is independent of class/instance

Called from: Both can be called from class or instance
